# Capstone Project

This project compares the average packet delay of the traditional Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) algorithm, called IPACT and the proposed DBA alorithm, called PD-DBA, which uses Machine Learning to predict next cycle Grant messages.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through the steps used in the Capstone Project evaluation.

### Files

`data-grant_time.csv`: It contains the input dataset of the Grant messages collected during a given simulation using the IPACT algorithm.

`delay_plot.py`: It saves into the img directory the (delay vs load) line chart of the DBA algorithms.

`ipact.sh`: It runs several simulations of the IPACT algorithm.

`g-sim.py`: The LR-PON simulator.

`pddba.sh`: It runs several simulations of the PD-DBA algorithm.

`test_predictor.py`: It runs the performance evaluation of a model varying the window of past observations and the number of predictions.

`test_predictor.sh`: It tests several models at the same time.

### Installing

pip install simpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels

### Evaluating model performance

Run the test_predictor.sh to test models' RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error varying window (`w=[10,20,30]`) and number of predictions (`p=[5,10,15,20]`). In a terminal window run the following command:

```
$ bash test_predictor.sh
```
The command above runs parallel test_predictor.py for the models OLS (LinearRegression), Ridge and Lasso in background. After several minutes, one output file ("model"-report.txt) for each model is filled with the test's descriptive statistics of the metrics. The directory `counter` contains examples of each output file, as following:

```
$ ls counter/
lasso-report.txt  ols-report.txt  ridge-report.txt
```

### Run the simulator

First simulate the IPACT algorithm:

```
$ bash ipact.sh
```

Then, simulate the PD-DBA algorithm:

```
$ bash pddba.sh
```

Run the following command to plot the delay chart into directory img:

```
python delay_plot.py "LR-PON with 3 ONUs"
```

```
$ ls img
Delay-LR-PON with 3 ONUs.png
```

*Warning*: To simulate using 10 different random seeds you should edit the files ipact.sh, pddba.sh and delay_plot.py, uncommenting the indicated lines. The complete simulations can take more than 1 hour.

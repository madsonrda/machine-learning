    "A decision tree represents a function that takes as input a vector of attribute values and returns a decision - a unique output value. Input and output values can be discrete or continuous. A decision tree reaches its decision by running a test sequence. Each inner tree node corresponds to a test on one of the input attributes, and the node branches are sorted with the possible values of the attribute. Each leaf node in the tree specifies the value to be returned by the function. Summarizing, the decision tree representation:\n",
    "* Each internal node tests an attribute;\n",
    "* Each branch corresponds to attribute value;\n",
    "* Each leaf node assigns a classification.\n",

The examples are processed by the tree from the root and following the appropriate branch until a leaf is reached. For example, a situation with Patrons = Full and WaitEstimae = 0-10 will be classified as positive (it means, we will wait for a table). In a decision tree, knowledge is represented by each node that, when tested, can lead the search to one of its children. Thus, by descending from the root towards the leaves of the tree, we can select the system configuration, and thus the associated behavior. But how is this tree generated?
